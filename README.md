# Fifa Pack Bot
A little pyautogui program used to automate fifa player picks in the EA web app (paletools needed)

The app is flagged as a virus by Windows, it is a false positive, but trust me at your own risk. I can guarantee there's no hidden code besides the one i've posted above. (I have no money to sign the app so that it doesn't flag)

How to use:
1. Install paletools and open the EA web app
2. Create a template for the pick/exchange you want to automate(Tutorials widely available on YouTube for step 1 and 2)
3. Open up the app and make sure not to cover the browser page with the cmd that will open
4. Let the bot do the packs for you
5. Enjoy packs and hopefully no softbans

Features:
Babysitter option (stops for 50 seconds after every 10 packs) in order to avoid getting softbaned

If you want to change the pick/exchange you want to automate simply screenshot the image of the pick and replace it, make sure to name it pick.png. (example below)

Known bugs:
The app might crash due to the site breaking (once every few picks the site will freeze and the bot won't be able to click anymore). In case this happens, simply refresh the page and fire it up again.
If you choose to replace the pick.png as shown above, the bot might not click exactly where it should, if this happens re-screenshot the pick and try again.
The app will crash...a lot, I've set the max amount of packs it can do to 50, but given the fact the site breaks often and you might run out of fodder for the picks, it might never reach that goal

To close the app you can wait for it to enter babysitter mode and exit it normally or fight against it's unflinching will and CTRL+C the cmd.

Have fun!!
